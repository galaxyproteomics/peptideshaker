title: PeptideShaker and SearchGUI in Galaxy
---

Together, [SearchGUI](http://searchgui.googlecode.com) and [PeptideShaker](http://peptideshaker.googlecode.com) form a free, cross platform, open source pipeline for peptide and protein identification including some downstream analysis.  This page describes efforts by the Galaxy proteomics community to bring the power of these two applications to Galaxy.
